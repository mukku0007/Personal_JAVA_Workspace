/*
Wrapper Class:- wrapper class provides the mechanism to convert primitive data type into 
				object type and object type into primitive is called wrapper class.

   
In java, We have 8 Primitive Data Types are there:-

 1. byte								Byte
 2. short								Short
 3. int 								Integer
 4. long								Long
 5. float								Float
 6. double								Double
 7. char								Character
 8. boolean								Boolean
 
 
 Note:- Primitive and wrapper class is same but, 
 		If the class starts with Upper Case Character is wrapper class. 
 		
Objective:-
 
1. To wrap primitive data type into Object form.

 10 => int => Integer
 
2. To define several Utility methods for Primitive.

  String s = Integer.toString(10);

 		
 Note:- We assign the integer into string but not string into integer.
