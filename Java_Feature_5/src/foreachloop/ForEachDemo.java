/*
 The Java for-each loop or enhanced for loop is introduced since J2SE 5.0. 
 It provides an alternative approach to traverse the array or collection in Java. 
 It is mainly used to traverse the array or collection elements.
 
 Syntax
 
 for(data_type variable : array | collection)
 {  
	//body of for-each loop  
 }
 
How it works?
The Java for-each loop traverses the array or collection until the last element. 
For each element, it stores the element in the variable and executes the body of the for-each loop.
